# Can of Books

**Author: Steve Gant**

## Overview
Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Throughout this module, you’ll create a small app to track what books have impacted you, and what’s recommended to read next.

Web applications essentially all work by managing data related to “resources”. The resources that an app cares about can be just about anything: a product for sale, an uploaded photo, a review, a bit of weather data… whatever it is that gets stored in a database. When the app provides the interface to create, read, update, and delete a resource, we refer to that as a CRUD app. Over the next few labs, you will build an app that has books as a resource.

For this assignment, you will READ book data by connecting your front-end React app to a back-end Express server. Your Express server will connect to a MongoDB database. You will need to make a “schema” in your back-end code to model how you want your data to look. You will then populate your database with “seed” data—some of your favorite books. When the front end makes a request to your server, your server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Your front end will display these results.

## Getting Started

Create GitHub repo and clone locally.

## Architecture

Application will be built using React, MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates

Name of feature: setup repos, setup db, setup book component

Estimate of time needed to complete: 3 hours

Start time: 1400

Finish time: 1800

Actual time needed to complete: 4 hours

## Credit and Collaborations

- Collaborated with Marco Villafana

## Collaboration Agreement

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - 1pm - 6pm

- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Primarily Remo. Slack if there are problems with Remo.

- How often will you take breaks?
  - Every hour

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Get help from TA or instructor

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
  - Marco: Analytical, curious
  - Steve: Organizational, research

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  - Analytical: find problems
  - Research: Find answers using tools available

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Steve: better understanding of wiring front end
  - Marco: working on clearer communication

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - Pair coding utilizing Driver - Navigator approach

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - Inform TM first, then get instructor involved if continues

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - Inform TM first, then get instructor involved if continues

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Driver - Navigator method. Talk through issues.
